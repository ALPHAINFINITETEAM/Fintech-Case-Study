## Overview and Origin

“Rip 20th Century” 
It is unbelievable how much our world has grown in technology and financial tools compared to what it was at the end of the 20th century (1999). This evolution is our “Rip Van Winkle” version!

[“Rip Van Winkle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle) is a short story by the American author Washington Irving, first published in 1819. It follows a Dutch-American villager in colonial America named Rip Van Winkle who meets mysterious Dutchmen, imbibes their liquor and falls asleep in the Catskill Mountains. He awakes 20 years later to a very changed world, having missed the American Revolution.
We can credit this great evolution to the marriage of Technology and Financial industries (FINTECH) which produced a range of domains changing our lives forever. One of the most important domains being Payments and Billing!

Payments and Billing. 
It is no secret online shopping has become our number one source for shopping. From household items , groceries , furnitures , electronics, cars , clothes , even homes are bought and sold online. Conveniency and more variety in choices will always win a consumers heart. 

* Stripe, Inc.
Stripe, Inc. ranks #1 in the Top 10 fintech payment platforms in 2022 according to [fintechmagazine.com](https://fintechmagazine.com/digital-payments/top-10-fintech-payment-platforms-to-watch-in-2022)

* The Irish-American financial services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, launched in 2010 by brothers Patrick and and John Collison, has revolutionised the ecommerce payment space, providing online retailers with a payment gateway that enables a wide range of transactions to be processed at low cost, and with frictionless speed and efficiency. 

* Patrick Collison was just 16 when he was awarded Young Scientist of the Year in 2005 ‒ and just 21 when he launched Stripe from his bedroom at his family home in Ireland with the support of his brother, John. Today, Stripe is dual-headquartered in San Francisco. It offers payment processing software and application programming interfaces for e-commerce websites and mobile applications. 

* Backtrack first decade of the new millennium, there was a perception that online payments were a solved problem. Dot-com darling PayPal Holdings Inc. had been around for more than a decade, but after it sold itself to eBay Inc., the company primarily catered to merchants there.

Before Stripe if you wanted to accept credit cards for your online venture you had essentially two options: Get a merchant account or use a payment gateway. To get a merchant account, you have to convince a bank that your business is valid and that your credit risk is low. Once you get approved, you have fees for each transaction, as well as monthly dues to keep your merchant account current. Payment gateways, like those offered by PayPal, Intuit, or Authorize.net, though easier to deploy, aren't dramatically cheaper. Rather than having your own merchant account, payment gateways accept credit cards on your behalf, but also slap you with monthly and transactional fees.
Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison launched Stripe around 2010 after dropping out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, respectively. Frustrated with the experience of getting their earlier business ventures approved for credit-card-processing accounts, the Collisons decided to build a solution themselves.

* Backed by PayPal founders Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Max Levchin, Stripe launched in 2011 to offer a third option. 

## Business Activities:

* The company sets up merchant accounts with banks so you don't have to. All you do is drop a few lines of code into your website and you have a payment form that you can brand anyway you like. There are no monthly or set-up fees, but for Stripe's trouble it keeps 2.9% of the purchase and a $0.30 transaction fee. Stripe started out by working with a group particularly neglected by banks: other startups. As customers such as Instacart Inc. and DoorDash Inc. broke out, Stripe broke out with them.

* Hello World!
According to co-founder Patrick Collison, the same merchant account woes that American merchants face exist all over the world. So, naturally, that is where he is headed next, outside the United States. Stripe's first stop is Canada, a logical choice and the first international foray for many U.S. companies because of the geographic and cultural comfort level it offers. Canada also offers Stripe a population of would-be online merchants who suffer long waits, onerous requirements, and antiquated technology, says Stripe beta-tester Colin Percival, who runs Tarsnap, a Vancouver, BC-based UNIX backup service. "For a long time, accepting credit cards in Canada meant dealing with banks — not a problem if you have millions of dollars of revenue, but far from a friendly process for a small business just starting up," says Percival. "Stripe makes all the problems of credit card processing go away."
Stripe is intent on taking its business – and hearing that sentiment – all over the world.
