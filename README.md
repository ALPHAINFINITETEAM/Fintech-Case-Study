## Overview and Origin

“Rip 20th Century” 
It is unbelievable how much our world has grown in technology and financial tools compared to what it was at the end of the 20th century (1999). This evolution is our “Rip Van Winkle” version!

[“Rip Van Winkle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle) is a short story by the American author Washington Irving, first published in 1819. It follows a Dutch-American villager in colonial America named Rip Van Winkle who meets mysterious Dutchmen, imbibes their liquor and falls asleep in the Catskill Mountains. He awakes 20 years later to a very changed world, having missed the American Revolution.
We can credit this great evolution to the marriage of Technology and Financial industries (FINTECH) which produced a range of domains changing our lives forever. One of the most important domains being Payments and Billing!

Payments and Billing. 
It is no secret online shopping has become our number one source for shopping. From household items , groceries , furnitures , electronics, cars , clothes , even homes are bought and sold online. Conveniency and more variety in choices will always win a consumers heart. 

* Stripe, Inc.
Stripe, Inc. ranks #1 in the Top 10 fintech payment platforms in 2022 according to [fintechmagazine.com](https://fintechmagazine.com/digital-payments/top-10-fintech-payment-platforms-to-watch-in-2022)

* The Irish-American financial services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, launched in 2010 by brothers Patrick and and John Collison, has revolutionised the ecommerce payment space, providing online retailers with a payment gateway that enables a wide range of transactions to be processed at low cost, and with frictionless speed and efficiency. 

* Patrick Collison was just 16 when he was awarded Young Scientist of the Year in 2005 ‒ and just 21 when he launched Stripe from his bedroom at his family home in Ireland with the support of his brother, John. Today, Stripe is dual-headquartered in San Francisco. It offers payment processing software and application programming interfaces for e-commerce websites and mobile applications. 

* Backtrack first decade of the new millennium, there was a perception that online payments were a solved problem. Dot-com darling PayPal Holdings Inc. had been around for more than a decade, but after it sold itself to eBay Inc., the company primarily catered to merchants there.

Before Stripe if you wanted to accept credit cards for your online venture you had essentially two options: Get a merchant account or use a payment gateway. To get a merchant account, you have to convince a bank that your business is valid and that your credit risk is low. Once you get approved, you have fees for each transaction, as well as monthly dues to keep your merchant account current. Payment gateways, like those offered by PayPal, Intuit, or Authorize.net, though easier to deploy, aren't dramatically cheaper. Rather than having your own merchant account, payment gateways accept credit cards on your behalf, but also slap you with monthly and transactional fees.
Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison launched Stripe around 2010 after dropping out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, respectively. Frustrated with the experience of getting their earlier business ventures approved for credit-card-processing accounts, the Collisons decided to build a solution themselves.

* Backed by PayPal founders Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Max Levchin, Stripe launched in 2011 to offer a third option. 

## Business Activities:

* The company sets up merchant accounts with banks so you don't have to. All you do is drop a few lines of code into your website and you have a payment form that you can brand anyway you like. There are no monthly or set-up fees, but for Stripe's trouble it keeps 2.9% of the purchase and a $0.30 transaction fee. Stripe started out by working with a group particularly neglected by banks: other startups. As customers such as Instacart Inc. and DoorDash Inc. broke out, Stripe broke out with them.

* Hello World!
According to co-founder Patrick Collison, the same merchant account woes that American merchants face exist all over the world. So, naturally, that is where he is headed next, outside the United States. Stripe's first stop is Canada, a logical choice and the first international foray for many U.S. companies because of the geographic and cultural comfort level it offers. Canada also offers Stripe a population of would-be online merchants who suffer long waits, onerous requirements, and antiquated technology, says Stripe beta-tester Colin Percival, who runs Tarsnap, a Vancouver, BC-based UNIX backup service. "For a long time, accepting credit cards in Canada meant dealing with banks — not a problem if you have millions of dollars of revenue, but far from a friendly process for a small business just starting up," says Percival. "Stripe makes all the problems of credit card processing go away."
Stripe is intent on taking its business – and hearing that sentiment – all over the world.

## Landscape:

* Stripe, Inc. is in the financial domain of Payments and Billing.

* From brilliant ecommerce solutions that have transformed the industry to cryptocurrency digital wallets and cross-border providers, digital payment platforms are thriving in the fintech space. Indeed, new innovations over the past decade have not only transformed the industry but the entire payments culture itself, enabling online shopping and ecommerce to truly flourish, as well as providing new opportunities to small businesses and consumers.[fintechmagazine.com](https://fintechmagazine.com/digital-payments/top-10-fintech-payment-platforms-to-watch-in-2022) listed the top 10 to watch this year as they expand and scale into new markets.

#10 Bolt
With a valuation of US$8.4bn, Bolt is on a mission to democratise commerce. Its one-click checkout product aims to give businesses the same technology Amazon has been using since 1997. At the same time, the fintech incorporates the use of payments and fraud services that ensure transactions are real and payments can be accepted. As the world's first checkout experience platform, Bolt offers a lightning-fast, one-click checkout and connects millions of shoppers to retailers through a unified, cross-brand network.

#9 Billd
Billd is a Texas-headquartered construction finance company that partners with regional and national suppliers across the U.S. to offer project-based financing to contractors. Its short-term financing solutions facilitate immediate payment to suppliers while providing contractors the flexibility to pay for material purchases over time. Billd co-founders, Chris Doyle and Jesse Weissburg, recognised how a lack of access to working capital impacts contractors’ ability to operate and grow their business.

#8 Affirm
Launched in 2012, Affirm is a publicly-traded, US-based financial technology company headquartered in San Francisco. The company is a financial lender in the sector of installment loans for consumers and although the jury is out on its valuation ‒ predictions range between US$1-10bn ‒ it remains an impressive leader in the digital payments space. The fintech business enables users to take out microloans at the point of sale with participating vendors and aims to provide a quick, transparent, and more inclusive lending alternative to credit cards.

#7 SpotOn
SpotOn provides mobile payment technology and management systems for restaurants and small businesses. Launched in 2017 and now with a valuation of US$3.15bn, the fintech startup takes great pride in providing one of the only objective and unbiased merchant account review websites on the internet. SpotOn’s free app for iPhone and Androids devices allows users to check-in at events and earn “spots” that can be redeemed for prizes as an additional incentive.

#6 Checkout.com
With a valuation of US$40bn, Checkout.com is one of the world’s leading payment platforms. It holds a firm position as a merchant services provider for international e-commerce merchants. Checkout.com’s overall product offering is fairly priced compared to competitors, and its platform integrates electronic payments, analytics, and fraud monitoring into one frictionless solution. The London-headquartered company also processes payments for big clients including Pizza Hut, H&M, and Farfetch, as well as fintechs like Coinbase, Klarna, and Revolut.

#5 AeroPay
AeroPay is an alternative payments company that allows customers to pay participating businesses through a direct bank transfer. The fintech’s payments solutions are designed to provide businesses with lower costs, faster settlement times, and enhanced security. AeroPay uses its patented payments process to enable 'smart bank transfers' between businesses and their customers (C2B) or other businesses (B2B).

#4 Braintree
Braintree is a full-stack payments platform that makes it easy to accept payments via your app or the website. Its service replaces the traditional model of sourcing a payment gateway and merchant account from different providers. 

Braintree is often compared to PayPal, but it differs in that it is aimed at higher-volume eCommerce businesses that need a lot of custom control over their payment processes. In contrast, PayPal is designed to be simple and easy to use for merchants with modest eCommerce needs.

#3 Clover
Clover is a cloud-based Android point-of-sale (PoS) platform that was launched in April 2012. The burgeoning fintech offers small business owners the chance to set themselves up as vendors, simply through downloading their app and opening an account on the Clover platform via their mobile phone. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, the company was founded by Kelvin Zheng, Leonard Speiser, Mark Schulze and John Beatty, the latter of whom is also the fintech’s reigning CEO. Clover is owned by Fiserv, a leading financial technology company, and has a predicted valuation of US$188bn by 2025 if it continues on its current growth trajectory.

#2 PayPal
One of the more established fintechs ‒ and perhaps most globally recognised ‒ PayPal was originally founded by Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek and Max Levchin in December 1998 as Confinity, a company that developed security software for handheld devices. However, with that particular business model, the concept failed to take off, so the founders switched the company’s focus to digital wallets.

In March 2000, still struggling to establish itself, Confinity merged with another early internet payment platform: X.com, headed up by Elon Musk. Musk became the CEO of the resulting company ‒ PayPal ‒ and, after much management wrangling due to leadership conflicts, Thiel briefly quit the company before returning as PayPal’s chairman. Musk continued as the company’s CEO until October 2002, when it was sold to eBay for US$1.5bn in stock. Today, it is worth more than US$130bn.

#1 Stripe
Stripe currently has a valuation of US$95bn and is a globally recognised company that looks set to make its IPO this year ‒ though this news is yet to be officially confirmed.

## Results :

* The company has two major trends in its favor: Investors view Stripe as an index of sorts for all of Silicon Valley, because it processes payments for plenty of fellow startups and tech companies—and Silicon Valley has thrived almost since the pandemic began. What’s more, people have embraced online shopping and are expected to keep at it even when Covid-19 fades. The pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce by two years, with online retail sales in the U.S. increasing in 2020 by nearly one-third to $795 billion, according to research firm eMarketer.

  Stripe’s revenue last year rose nearly 70%, to about $7.4 billion, according to people with knowledge of the company’s finances. Other startups might       have flashier apps or more recognized brands, but Stripe showed that it is better to be a workhorse than a show pony.

* Now sitting atop a $95 billion valuation—the highest for a private Silicon Valley company, according to data firm PitchBook—Stripe is bulking up overseas, preparing to go public and working to build a one-stop financial supermarket for the internet economy.

## Recommendations

* From Launch to growth, then peak, Stripe has experienced a great success so far and deserve its number 1 ranking in the payment and billing domain. Business science, however, predicts companies often struggle to remain successful after reaching their peak. With growing competition, Stripe would need to be creative by adding new products to remain at the top of their domain. I believe Commercial Banking and accepting deposits would be the perfect start. 

* Stripe, Inc.  has provided solutions for millions of their customers around the world by revolutionizing payment processing. Strip, Inc. is perfectly positioned to dive into the commercial banking industry with the millions of customers already in their database. By offering free deposit accounts and low interest lines of credits, it would be a no brainer for their customers to transfer over. Stripe , Inc. would automatically be in charge of billions of deposits to convert and offer many other new products such as lines of credits , credit cards, real estate loans, etc …. 

* Conventional banking with brick-and-mortar would be very limited for emergency purchases in need of Cash Withdrawals and other matters where physical interactions are necessary. Majority of businesses would be handled online. 

* Consumer digital accounting opening is the most popular technology for the fourth year in a row—with banks (finally) leading the way here.
According to [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2021/01/18/the-5-hottest-technologies-in-banking-for-2021/?sh=57efb41135c4), Commercial digital account opening systems (for corporations and small businesses) will get a boost this year as well, as 30% of banks anticipate choosing a new system this year, up from 22% in 2020.
This shouldn’t come as a surprise. According to Cornerstone Advisors partner Quintin Sykes, “the commercial account opening and onboarding experience is one of the biggest pain points remaining in the digital experience.”Commercial digital account opening systems are gaining in popularity among credit unions, as well. One in 10 credit unions plan to implement a new commercial account opening system in 2021—twice the number that has done so in the past three years.

Digital Commercial Banking accounts added to Stripe, Inc. new business products would certainly be a new game Changer!
